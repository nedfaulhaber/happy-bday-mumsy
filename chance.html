        <p>Though he'd been on the scene for awhile, for anyone outside of hip-hop fans, Chance the Rapper had been lurking in the background.  His recordings were scattered between singles, EP's, and guest appearances.  Those days are gone - 2016 was definitely his coming out party, and in a giant way.  For one, he guested on the first track of fellow-Chicagoan Kanye West's <em>Life of Pablo</em>, and <span class="info-link"><a href="https://revolt.tv/videos/performance-kanye-west-performs-ultra-lights-beams-snl-0e6c6c75">performed with Kanye</a></span> live on Saturday Night Live (how many artists have broken big thanks to Kanye's keen ear?).  Immediately following this public exposure, he finally (with an asterisk - he's only 23 years old) released his first full-length album, <em>Coloring Book</em>, which technically was a "mixtape", meaning a self-released album, with no record label.  This (free) release and his exclusive deal with Apple Music, was one of two such releases and deals this year (the other was Frank Ocean's new record) that shook the established music industry to its core, signalling that a new era is coming where record labels may be unnecessary.  Despite having no label, Chance's deal with Apple was more than enough for him to become a massive superstar known worldwide, culminating in the Grammy for Best New Artist.  His appearance in commercials (like one for Kit Kat candy bars!) has been another big money-maker for him, and again points to a new era for "independent" artists, who traditionally were completely outside such corporate ties.  Chance is doing things his own way, and unlike Frank Ocean, he has embraced the establishment despite giving the proverbial middle finger to the biggest establishment in music - the labels and distributors who have controlled recorded music since its beginnings.</p>
        <p>"Same Drugs", which he <span class="info-link"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKbEsG5XoO0">performed on SNL</a></span>, isn't literally about drugs, according to Chance.  Drugs are one of two metaphors that the song is built around to describe a childhood love and how they have grown apart from each other.  The other metaphor revolves around the re-envisioning of the Peter Pan story, the film  <em>Hook</em>, starring Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman.  This song points to the fact that though he is known as a rapper, he spends as much time, if not more, singing with his gospel-inflected gravelly voice.  A very public Christian, his gospel influence is everywhere on <em>Coloring Book</em>, and especially on this song, with gospel singers joining him mid-way through.</p>
        <p>It's hard to imagine an artist having a year with more impact than Chance did in 2016.  With his infectious smile and positivity, his charitable nature (he pledged a million dollars recently to the Chicago public school system), his continued appearances on other artists' work (like his vocal on the <em>Hamilton Mixtape</em>), and his young age, it seems that Chance's star is going to keep shining brighter and brighter in the coming years.</p>
