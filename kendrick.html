        <p>It's no exaggeration to say that no other rapper has as much presence in the last few years as Kendrick Lamar.  He's been a hero to the black power movement and has been making appearances on seemingly everyone's records, lending his incredible lyrical and rhythmic virtuosity to songs from artists as diverse as Taylor Swift, A Tribe Called Quest, The Weeknd, Flying Lotus, and Sia - and that's a tiny slice. In his own music, he speaks truth to his own experiences - both as a gang kid in Compton and the man that rose above it via a devotion to God and his craft.  But what's great about Kendrick is that nothing is so clean.  The classic narrative of poor kid making good and reforming through some sort of magical salvation and talent is p>

        <p>There has been cause for optimism since that time, as Cudi released the new album while still in treatment, and despite not being able to promote it in person, the album debuted at number 11 on the charts and garnered positive reviews, with some critics calling it his best work ever.  The album has been criticized for its length, but the compelling and unique emotional canvas that it paints seems to override this as an issue, at least to this critic ;) .  Multiple major artists collaborated on the project, including Pharrell Williams, Travis Scott, and Andre Benjamin (aka Andre 3000 from the hip-hop supergroup Outkast, who put Atlanta rap in the spotlight in the 90's).  "By Design", the first single from the new album, features Andre on the choruses and bridge, in top form.  With this high-octane performance from Andre, the island vibe and infectious beat, and Cudi's Peter Tosh-esque vocal, the track is a truly brilliant and unique work.</p>
        <p>More importantly, it appears that Cudi is doing well after leaving treatment in early 2017.  He is planning a tour, and performed his song "Kitchen", featuring a string section, on <em>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</em> two weeks ago.  A recent feud with his original benefactor, Kanye West, has also been smoothed.  Hopefully there will be continued cause for hope for this troubled and brilliant Clevelander.</p>
