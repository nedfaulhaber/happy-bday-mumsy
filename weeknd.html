        <p>In summer 2015, I heard through a pop culture podcast that there were two songs currently in the top 5, one of which was the anthem of the summer, and I was shocked to hear that the artist behind these hits was none other than Canadian Abel Tesfaye, a.k.a. The Weeknd.  I had been a huge Weeknd fan for 4 years, ever since downloading the free <em>House of Balloons</em> mixtape that I heard about through friends.  The dark-as-night vibe of the music, both in sound and lyrical content, was enhanced by the mysterious quality of the artist behind it.  Who was The Weeknd?  There were no pictures of him anywhere, other than silhouette shots, no hint to his real name, only that he was from Toronto and was really young.  A few years later, he started turning up as a guest on some major artists' songs (most notably "Elastic Heart", the Sia song on the <em>Hunger Games</em> soundtrack), and then dropped his first official album, <em>Kissland</em>.  Much like his mixtape, <em>Kissland</em>, despite a cameo from fellow Toronto native and hip-hop superstar Drake, was full of dark, moody, long songs that were far from anything that would chart on Billboard or get radio play.  His Michael Jackson-esque voice was often buried under effects, and the music was deeply atmospheric and once again, the lyrics portrayed a young man self-aware of his hedonism, unapologetic but clearly understanding the destructive nature of his behavior.  His candidness wasn't without precedent, but it showed an emotional intelligence that you'd never find in other notably self-destructive men such as Keith Richards, Eazy-E, or Jim Morrison.</p>
        <p>So in 2015, to imagine that The Weeknd could possibly be a chart-topper was mind-boggling.  I sought out the songs, "I Can't Feel My Face" and "The Hills", and was blown away by the fact that he had truly crossed over - these were ridiculously catchy (especially the former track) but retained the double-sided take on partying evident in his earlier material.  With "The Hills", the dark, syrupy vibe was still there, but the hook of the song was infectious.  And the Michael Jackson within Tesfaye was front and center on the super-hit of the summer, "I Can't Feel My Face".  </p>
